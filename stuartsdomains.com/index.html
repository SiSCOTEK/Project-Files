        <p>All of the domains listed on this website are for sale at 1,000 
		dollars each.</p>
        <p>However, each sale’s agreement will include a clause that gives the 
		seller, Stuart Chalem,<br>8 % of the quarterly net profits, realized via 
		sales that are derived from visitors to the site.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in finding out more about buying my domains,

        <!--
        <p>I have created and registered the following domain names for commercial purposes, but not for sale because I would like to partner with anyone who is interested in the domains and has a product or service that could be sold successfully on local, countrywide and worldwide markets.</p>
        <p>A number of my registered domains have been successful and are currently websites which I control totally.</p>
        <p>I would like to propose the idea of parnering with any entity, individual, company or corporation that has a product or service that they would like to market and create ongoing profits for both myself and the partnering entity, if one of my domains relates to the service or product that would be marketed.</p>
        <p>I would transfer my registration to the partner or partners with the stipulation that I would get a specific percentage of monthly profits based on sales that come from the website and domain name created.</p>
